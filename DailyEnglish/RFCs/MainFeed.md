# RFC: Daily Words Application - MainFeed Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation details for the MainFeed feature of the Daily Words application, a SwiftUI-based iOS app that helps users learn English words daily.

## Goals
- Create an engaging and intuitive interface for learning new English words
- Provide clear pronunciation guidance through phonetic alphabet
- Enable social sharing and interaction features
- Implement voice pronunciation support
- Allow users to save favorite words for later reference

## User Interface Design

### Layout Structure
1. Main Card View (Centered)
   - English Word (Large, prominent display)
   - Phonetic Alphabet (International Phonetic Alphabet format)
   - Word explanation/definition (Concise, clear description)

2. Action Bar (Below Card)
   - Share button (Left-aligned)
   - Voice pronunciation button (Center-left)
   - Like button (Center-right)
   - Save/bookmark button (Right-aligned)

### Visual Hierarchy
1. Primary Focus
   - Word Display: 32pt SF Pro Display Bold
   - Phonetic Text: 18pt SF Pro Text Regular
   - Definition: 16pt SF Pro Text Regular

2. Secondary Elements
   - Action buttons: 24x24pt SF Symbols
   - Consistent padding: 16pt standard spacing

### Interaction Design
1. Card View
   - Subtle shadow and elevation
   - Light bounce animation on appearance
   - Support for dark/light mode

2. Action Buttons
   - Share: System share sheet integration
   - Voice: Clear audio playback with visual feedback
   - Like: Heart animation on tap
   - Save: Bookmark animation with haptic feedback

## Technical Specifications

### Core Components
1. `MainFeedView`
   - Primary container view
   - Manages state and user interactions

2. `WordCardView`
   - Displays word information
   - Handles card animations

3. `ActionBarView`
   - Contains interaction buttons
   - Manages button actions

### Data Model

swift
struct WordModel {
let word: String
let phonetic: String
let definition: String
let audioUrl: URL?
var isLiked: Bool
var isSaved: Bool
}

### State Management
- Use `@StateObject` for word data
- Implement `ObservableObject` for user interactions
- Maintain persistent storage for liked/saved words

## Accessibility Considerations
- VoiceOver support for all text elements
- Dynamic Type compatibility
- Sufficient color contrast
- Clear touch targets (minimum 44x44pt)

## Performance Requirements
- Smooth animations (60 FPS)
- Immediate response to user interactions
- Efficient memory usage
- Quick audio playback initialization

## Future Considerations
1. Offline Support
   - Local storage for saved words
   - Cached audio files

2. Personalization
   - User difficulty preferences
   - Custom word lists
   - Learning progress tracking

3. Social Features
   - Word sharing statistics
   - User word collections
   - Community contributions

## Success Metrics
- User engagement time
- Word retention rate
- Share/save action frequency
- User satisfaction ratings
